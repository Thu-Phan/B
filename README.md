# **Note:** 
- This is the code for Calc dataset. For Mass dataset, use the same codebase, only need to change the directory at train.py and evaluate.py
- Change the boolean quicktest at train.py and evaluate.py, TRUE to test if the file work correctly and FALSE for real training
- d.py is the dataloader
# **Running:** run train.py first, then run evaluate.py
